# Wi-Fi Controlled Car using ESP8266 NodeMCU

This project demonstrates how to build a Wi-Fi controlled car using the ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller, L298N motor driver, two 3.6V DC motors, and a mobile application for control. The project involves setting up a webpage to control the movement of the car via a Wi-Fi network.

## Project Components 

- **ESP8266 NodeMCU**: Acts as the microcontroller to receive commands from the mobile device via Wi-Fi.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Controls the direction and speed of the DC motors.
- **DC Motors (2x 3.6V)**: Used to drive the car's movement.
- **Rear Wheels (2x)**: Provide stability and movement to the car.
- **360Â° Front Wheel**: Helps in controlling the direction of the car.
- **12V Battery**: Powers the L298N motor driver.
- **Mobile Application**: A simple webpage to send control signals to the NodeMCU.

## Features

- Control the car's movement (forward, backward, left, right) using a mobile app through Wi-Fi.
- Speed control of the motors.
- Simple user interface with intuitive controls.
